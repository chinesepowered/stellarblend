## What's Real vs Enhanced for Demo

### ‚úÖ **100% Real - Production Ready**
- **Freighter Wallet Integration**: Real detection, connection, authorization via @stellar/freighter-api
- **Transaction Building**: Generates authentic Stellar XDRs using @blend-capital/blend-sdk
- **Wallet State Management**: Persistent connection across browser sessions
- **UI/UX Architecture**: Production-ready React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Network Configuration**: Real testnet endpoints and contract addresses
- **Security**: Non-custodial, transaction transparency, no private key handling

### üéØ **Enhanced for Demo Reliability**
- **Position Data**: Realistic mock data with live calculations (prevents demo failures)
- **Pool Information**: Simulated with real market-like values and APY rates
- **Achievement System**: Mock badge unlocking with real progress tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Simulated portfolio optimizations with realistic outcomes

### üî® **Real Transaction Building Details**
```typescript
// Actual XDR generation happening:
- Supply transactions with real asset addresses
- Borrow transactions with proper risk calculations  
- Transaction preview with full parameter display
- Console logging of authentic Blend SDK operations
- Ready for Freighter signing in production
```
